# Overview
## What is a Top 10 Journal?
I keep a journal that I write in every morning.  The point of this journal is to list the top 10 things I want most in life. There are a few rules you need to follow in order for this journal to actually work and mean something to you:

1. You write "I am happy and greatful because..."
2. You then list up to 10 things that would make you happy. However you must write it in the past tense as if you have already accomplished or achieved it.
3. You are not allowed to look at lists you have made in the past.  This makes it so that over time you truly start writing down things that you genuinely want in life.

I have kept this journal for about six months and it is actually pretty incredible to look back at lists I have created and see how much of it has actually come true.

## What this program does
This program is a Top 10 Journal that creates entries and stores them in a FireStore database. It was created in Python and I used the Kivy library and language in order to create a GUI.
